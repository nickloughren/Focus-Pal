# 😁📚StudyShame📚😁
### The accountability partner for those without a real study buddy.

StudyShame uses guilt & passive aggression to keep you on task and make sure you don't miss your targets. It includes a countdown timer and a periodic semi-random check-in to ensure that you're always on task. 

Other features include:

- Optional screenshot and photo evidence capture: makes it harder to justify your procastination and/or lie. Evidence can be stored locally for further scrutiny if nessecary.
- "Count-up" timer: allows you to keep going after you complete your goal.
- Progress plot: visualizes your progess over time.
- Automatic cut-off time (default 9:30PM): encourages a regular sleep schedule and prevents working late into the night.
- Dark mode. Dark mode only. 
- "Give up" button: for quitters and/or absolute emergency situations.
- Encouraging messages throughout to help motivate you.
- Disappointed messages when you fail or consider giving up.
